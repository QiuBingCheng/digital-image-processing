This chapter is an introduction to a number of basic concepts in digital image processing.

The topics discussed are as follows

* Important aspects of the human visual system
* Light, other components of the electromagnetic spectrum, and their imaging characteristics
* Imaging sensors and how they are used to generate digital images.
* The concepts of uniform image sampling and intensity quantization.
* Digital image representation, the effects of varying the number of samples and intensity levels in an image.
* Variety of basic relationships between pixels.

# Elements of Visual Perception
The human eye uses ***cons*** for color and sharp vision bright light and ***rods*** for black-and-light, motion sensitive vision in the dark.

| Feature                | Cones                       | Rods                            |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Function**           | Color vision & details      | Night vision & motion detection |
| **Best in**            | Bright light                | Low light                       |
| **Location**           | Fovea (center of retina)    | Peripheral retina               |
| **Number**             | ~6 million                  | ~120 million                    |
| **Color Sensitivity**  | Yes (RGB: red, green, blue) | No (monochrome)                 |
| **Light Sensitivity**  | Low                         | High                            |
| **Sharpness (Acuity)** | Low                         | Low                             |

# Light And the Electromagnetic Spectrum
 * **Shorter wavelengths**: High frequency, stronger energy, shorter distance.
* **Longer wavelengths**: Lower frequency, weaker energy, longer distance.
 * Each massless particle contains a certain amount (or bundle) of energy, called a ***photon***.

## 
The electromagnetic spectrum can be expressed in terms of wavelength, frequency, or energy. Wavelength ($\lambda$) and frequency ($v$) are related by the expression

$${\lambda = }{c \over v}$$

where $c$ is the speed of light (2.998 * 108 m/s).
